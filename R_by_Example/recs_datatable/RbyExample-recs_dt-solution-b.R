# R by Example: Analyzing RECS using data.table
# Solution to participant example (b)
#
# In this script, we use the 2015 RECS data to examine 
# how thermostat behavior impacts the difference between day and night
# temperatures in winter, while someone is home. 
#
# Specifically, this sript estimates the national average difference between
# temperatures during the day when someone is home and at night
# grouped by thermostat behavior, among homes that that use space heating.

## Refer to the link below for std error computations, see page 3
## the standard error is the square root of the variance estimate
